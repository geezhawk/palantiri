# Simple Guide to Contributing

## Be Nice and Have Fun

This is an awesome project with awesome people working on it! Let's have some fun crushing some code and maybe even learn something along the way.

## Issue tracker

Please check the [Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/danlrobertson/palantiri/issues), and assign yourself to any issues that you would like to work on.
In addition, please submit issues to the issue tracker if you have an idea that you would like to add to the project. At least for the time being my
vision is to treat it less like a bug tracker and more like a whiteboard to talk about goals for the project and features. If you have a more "solidified"
idea that you have already hacked up a reasonable solution for, feel free to forgo this step and submit a [Merge Request](https://gitlab.com/danlrobertson/palantiri/merge_requests).

I'm a fan of tags, so I may have gone a little overboard :smile:
